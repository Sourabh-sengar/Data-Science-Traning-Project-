#DataSet :- Provided by Internshala 

•	Data Science Project – In this project I worked on the bike rental system and was asked to forecast the total rental bikes for upcoming 6 months. The data set for the purpose of training and testing was already provided so data scrapping part is excluded. I started to organise the data and started analysis about the data set and then started cleaning the data for the possible error that it may cause later and then it was the hypothesis building based on the problem statement and after forming the hypothesis started working on the model building doing the necessary statistical calculation and training the model so that it can perform the necessary prediction. Also perform RMSLE analysis to evaluate the quality of the predictions
